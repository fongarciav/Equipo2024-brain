    Strategy for parallel parking to the right using a timed phase sequence.

    ## Parking space and vehicle dimensions
        Vehicle:        38 cm long × 21 cm wide
        Parking space:  80 cm long (Y) × 35 cm wide (X)

    ## Coordinate system (origin = rear-right corner of vehicle at maneuver start)
        +X  → into the parking space (lateral)
        +Y  → into the parking space (longitudinal / depth)

    ## Speed conversion
        All motion speeds are defined in cm/s and converted to UI units at
        construction time using:

            speed_ui = round(speed_cm_per_s / ui_speed_to_cm_per_s)

        The default conversion factor (ui_speed_to_cm_per_s = 0.3) was
        calibrated empirically: the car travelled ~450 cm in 80 s at
        speed_ui = 1, giving 450 / (80 × 1) = 5.625 cm/s per UI unit at
        low speed.  For maneuver speeds a factor of 0.3 is used.

    ## Phase geometry
        The classic three-arc parallel-parking maneuver is used:

        FORWARD_LEFT — advance with full-left steering for forward_left_distance_cm
            Angles the car toward the parking space entrance before reversing.

        BACK_RIGHT  — reverse with full-right steering for back_right_distance_cm
            Enters the space diagonally.

        BACK_LEFT   — reverse with full-left steering for back_left_distance_cm
            Mirrors BACK_RIGHT to straighten the car inside the space.

        After these three arcs the vehicle is parallel to the space walls and
        fully inside the 80 × 35 cm rectangle.

    ## Phase sequence
        WAIT          → Autopilot drives; duration = wait_target_distance_cm /
                        current_speed_cm_per_s so the car travels exactly
                        wait_target_distance_cm before the maneuver starts.
        BRAKE1        → Hold stop for brake_duration s.
        FORWARD_LEFT  → Advance full-left for forward_left_distance_cm to
                        angle the car toward the space entrance.
        BACK_RIGHT    → Reverse full-right for back_right_distance_cm.
        BACK_LEFT     → Reverse full-left  for back_left_distance_cm.
        STOP          → Hold stop for stop_hold_duration s, then finish.

    A cooldown prevents re-triggering while the maneuver is in progress.
